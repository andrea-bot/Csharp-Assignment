2.
What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is boxing and unboxing?
⦁	value type will directly hold the value, while reference type will hold the memory address or reference for this value
⦁	value types are stored in stack memory, while reference type will be stored in heap memory
⦁	value types are stored in stack memory, while reference type will be stored in heap memory
⦁	value types are stored in stack memory, while reference type will be stored in heap memory
⦁	value type will not be collected by garbage collector, while reference type will be collected by garbage collector
 
 
convert a value type to reference type -- boxing
convert a reference type to a value type -- unboxing

4.	What is the difference between x = y++; and x = ++y;? 
y++ executes the statement and then increments the value.
++y increments the value and then executes the statement.
++y happens prior to assignment (pre-increment), but y++ happens after assignment (post-increment). 
5.What is the difference between break, continue, and return when used inside a loop statement? 
Break statement breaks the loop/switch whereas continue skip the execution of current iteration only and it does not break the lop/switch. i.e. it passes the control to the next iteration of the enclosing while loop, do while loop, for loop of for each statement in which it appears.
6.	What are the three parts of a for statement and which of them are required? 
Initialization, Condition, and the advancement to the next iteration.
None is required.
  
7.What is the difference between the = and == operators?

8.Does the following statement compile? for ( ; true; ) ; 
Yes.
9.	What does the underscore _ represent in a switch expression?
